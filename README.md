IQ Robot base systems using L01 SLAM Nav System

The RV1000AED series robot utilizes an uppward facing camera for visual tracking paired with odometry data.

The SOC for the navigation system is the Rockchip RV1108, 128Mb DDR, 512Mb SPI Flash.

This system has been illusive when trying to gain access. I am able to view the boot log through UART, but keyboard inputs freeze the system.
Using the ADC Key input, I can get into MASKROM mode, but I cannot read or write to the flash.

This system isvery much a work in progress as I would also liketo gain access to this system too for self provisioning.
